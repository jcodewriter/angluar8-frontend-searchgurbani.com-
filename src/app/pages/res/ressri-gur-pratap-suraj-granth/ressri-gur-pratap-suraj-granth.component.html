                    <hr>
                    <h5><strong>Sri Gur Pratap Suraj Granth</strong></h5>
                    <p class="blue">Authored by ‘Kavi Churamani’ Bhai Santokh Singh ji, Doyen of
                        Nirmala Sect, ‘Sri Gur
                        Partap Suraj Granth’ popularly known as ‘Suraj Parkash’ is a
                        voluminous classical medieval source
                        of Sikh History and Philosophy. Its ‘Katha’ (Religious Discourse) in almost
                        all prominent Gurdwaras is
                        the gauge of its authenticity and popularity among the Sikh masses. </p>
                    <p class="blue">Bhai Santokh Singh's monumental work in Braj verse portraying in
                        comprehensive detail the lives of the
                        Ten Gurus of the Sikh faith and the career of Banda Singh Bahadur. Besides being an
                        historical narrative of great
                        significance, it is an outstanding creation in the style epic, and is the most
                        voluminous of all poetic compositions
                        in Hindi/Punjabi literature. Its language is Braj Bhasa which was the literary Hindi of
                        that time though its script
                        is Gurmukhi. Notwithstanding certain drawbacks which scholars with training in modern
                        historiography may point out,
                        it remains the most valuable source book on Sikh history of the period of the Gurus and,
                        indeed, on the very roots
                        of the entire Sikh tradition. For the massive flow of its poetry, the vast range of its
                        figures and images and for
                        the abundance of detail, Sri Gur Pratap Suraj Granth, Suraj Prakash in shorter, popular
                        form, is worthy to rank with
                        the classics in this genre.</p>
                    <p class="blue">The title of the main work carries a symbolic meaning summed up in the
                        cosmic metaphor of suraj, i.e.
                        the sun. The poet himself explains, "As the sun rises, the darkness of the night
                        vanishes, thieves and thugs
                        hide themselves, owls and bats go to slumber and the stars disappear, so with the advent
                        of the Gurus, the rays of
                        their spiritual light spread all around dispelling the darkness of ignorance."</p>
                    <p class="blue">The work is divided into two parts. The first, Sri Gur Nanak Prakash in two
                        sections, is the story of
                        the life of Guru Nank. The second, Sri Gur Pratap Suraj proper, is divided into
                        portions, rut (season), according to
                        the twelve signs of the zodiac, sub-divided into chapters called arisu (rays). In the
                        Sri Gur Nanak Parkash portion,
                        the style of the narrative tends to be more elaborate, with many a stanza given to
                        homage to the Gurus, the Guru
                        Granth Sahib and to the patron deities of learning. The latter part, which deals with
                        the lives of succeeding nine
                        Gurus and Banda Singh Bahadur, contains 51,829 verse pieces in 22 cantos. The expression
                        here is less rhetoric. Both
                        the parts are further sub-divided into numerous sections according to the episodes
                        narrated, each named after the
                        sun's course, viz. the twelve zodaical signs, the six seasons and the two solstices
                        (winter and summer solstices)
                        which in turn comprise 1151 sunbeams, each one comprising a chapter. The phrase and
                        imagery in both the parts of the
                        book generally require expert explanation. This has been provided, painstakingly and
                        exhaustively, by Bhai Vir Singh
                        in a 14-volume annotated edition brought out in 1927-35. Bhai Vir Singh has also added
                        notes where necessary.</p>
                    <p class="blue">It is usual for gianis (learned scholars) to hold serial discourses on the
                        text of Suraj Prakash in
                        gurdwaras, normally in the afternoons or evenings.</p>
